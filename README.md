Hey guys,

I tried to automate the EXP grinding in Pokemon Yellow with image recognition.
So I wrote this little script, but its very basic... It lets the character walk left right until an encounter appears and then fight it with the first attack of the Pokemon.
After you defeated the Pokemon you will start walking left and right again.
I want to add a remaining AP and HP check in future and maybe some logic if the attack is not very effective on the enemy and then switch it.
